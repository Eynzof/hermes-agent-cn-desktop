Hermes Agent CN Desktop is a lightweight desktop client for the Hermes Agent Chinese community edition. It is built with [Tauri v2](https://v2.tauri.app/), Rust, React, and TypeScript, and it wraps the [hermes-agent-cn](https://github.com/Eynzof/hermes-agent-cn) Dashboard with a native desktop shell.

> Current release: `v0.1.0-alpha.1`. The project is still in alpha. APIs, packaging, runtime distribution, and UI details may change before the first stable release.

## Why this project exists

Hermes Agent already provides a local Dashboard. This repository focuses on the desktop experience around that Dashboard: native windows, local process management, file dialogs, managed runtime installation, runtime diagnostics, and a safer production transport layer for REST and SSE traffic.

This repository is the desktop shell. The agent runtime and Dashboard source live in [hermes-agent-cn](https://github.com/Eynzof/hermes-agent-cn).

## Highlights

- **Lightweight desktop shell**: Tauri uses the system WebView instead of bundling Chromium.
- **Managed runtime workflow**: the desktop app can install, update, verify, and roll back the local Hermes runtime.
- **Agent-first UI**: chat, streaming responses, attachments, MCP tools, skills, memory, profiles, scheduled tasks, and runtime health panels.
- **Production transport bridge**: Rust commands proxy REST requests, uploads, and SSE streams to avoid WebView CORS limitations and centralize auth handling.
- **Local-first defaults**: the managed Dashboard uses port `9120` by default, leaving `9119` free for a user-managed global Hermes Agent.
- **Cross-platform release target**: macOS DMG and Windows NSIS installers are built by GitHub Actions.

## Download

Pre-release builds are published on the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/Eynzof/hermes-cn-desktop-v2/releases) page.

The current alpha release includes:

- macOS Apple Silicon DMG: `Hermes.Agent.CN.Desktop_0.1.0_aarch64.dmg`
- Windows x64 installer: `Hermes.Agent.CN.Desktop_0.1.0_x64-setup.exe`

The Windows installer currently stages a bundled `hermes-agent-cn` runtime. The macOS build uses the managed runtime download/update flow on first launch.

## Requirements for development

- [Rust](https://rustup.rs/) stable
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 20+
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) 9+
- [hermes-agent-cn](https://github.com/Eynzof/hermes-agent-cn) or an installed Hermes CLI for local Dashboard development

macOS also needs Xcode Command Line Tools:

```bash
xcode-select --install
```

## Quick start

Install dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

Start the Hermes Dashboard in a separate terminal:

```bash
hermes dashboard --host 127.0.0.1 --port 9120 --no-open
```

Start the desktop app in development mode:

```bash
pnpm web:dev
cargo run
```

You can also let the Tauri dev command start the Vite dev server:

```bash
pnpm tauri:dev
```

## Build

```bash
# Production build for the current platform
pnpm tauri:build

# Debug build with debug symbols
pnpm tauri:build:debug
```

Build artifacts are written under `target/release/bundle/` or `target/debug/bundle/`.

## Common commands

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `pnpm web:dev` | Start the Vite dev server on port `9545` |
| `cargo run` | Compile and launch the Tauri desktop window |
| `pnpm typecheck` | Run TypeScript checks across the workspace |
| `pnpm test:unit` | Run Vitest unit tests |
| `cargo check` | Run Rust compile checks |
| `cargo test --all-features` | Run Rust tests |
| `pnpm tauri:build` | Build production desktop bundles |

## Quality gates

Before opening a pull request, please run the relevant checks:

```bash
pnpm typecheck
pnpm test:unit
cargo fmt --all -- --check
cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo test --all-features --no-fail-fast
```

CI runs separate frontend and Rust workflows on `main` and pull requests targeting `main`.

## Release process

Releases use SemVer tags:

```text
v0.1.0-alpha.1
v0.1.0-beta.1
v0.1.0
v0.1.1
```

Pushing a `v*` tag triggers `.github/workflows/release-desktop.yml`, which builds and uploads desktop installers to GitHub Releases. Alpha, beta, and release-candidate tags are marked as GitHub pre-releases.

## Roadmap

The short-term roadmap is focused on:

- hardening the managed runtime installation and update path;
- improving first-run onboarding and provider setup;
- expanding diagnostics for Dashboard, gateway, MCP, skills, and model configuration;
- polishing macOS and Windows packaging behavior;
- documenting the desktop/runtime boundary for contributors.
